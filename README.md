# Automatic Characterization of Subcellular Alterations in Photoreceptor Axons of Drosophila Melanogaster

### Abstract
Long before symptoms of neurodegeneration emerge, neurons accumulate subtle molecular alterations which lead to early cellular and subcellular changes in axons triggering axonal degeneration, impairing neuronal communication and subsequently resulting in neuronal death. To better understand these early events, a Drosophila model of sporadic neurodegeneration, the most common form affecting neuronal networks, was developed (Richard, Doubkova et al., 2022). This system can be used to study early-stage alterations in axonal morphology including microtubule organization, synapse loss and changes in mitochondria. 
The aim of the masterâ€™s thesis is the automatic instance segmentation and quantification of 3D microscopy images of neuronal networks in Drosophila. In particular, the degradation upon light stimuli will be investigated and successive damage to regular structures should be quantitatively assessed by dedicated features that are to be developed. Additional parameters and their feasibility will be discussed with the collaboration partners at the Chair for Developmental Biology at RWTH Aachen. The functionality of the developed algorithms is to be confirmed both qualitatively and quantitatively in validation experiments and ideally should lead to a pipeline that is applicable for new data[1].
